# READ-DEAD-BLOCKS
The journey with SFML library started with this project. I created a game where user is supposed to 'kill' all enemies - red blocks. Firstly, user needs to type in his nickname and pass simple tutorial which represents the main game. After passing hes being transfered to another window where top 10. scorers are placed.
  
Important keys are:
  -
  - W - shooting
  - L - going left
  - R - going right
